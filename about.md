Currently studying Data Visualisation design at University Of the Arts London. I have a passionate about creating different visual language to reveal the story behind the human life. Just as Lupi says,'Data represent the real life'. I love use different dataset to narrative a storytelling. I have created pieces of works and different themes to illustrate the topics.
